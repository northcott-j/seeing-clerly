                <h4>Bostonongraphy Analysis</h4>
                This tool allowed us to find some interesting trends in the data by comparing different schools and locations.
                Using these tools it is possible to see the effects of laws and policy when they come into effect.
                For example when Massachusetts legalized marijuana through a ballot initiative, there was a huge drop off
                in drug arrests between 2015-2016 (Figure 1). This can be contrasted with consistent or rising drug arrests
                in states that have not reduced the penalty for marijuana, such as South Carolina (Figure 2).
                This data can be used to show the effects of policy when it gets put in action. This is invaluable
                to college administrations that want to see if their policy changes are working. One of the central policy
                changes across the country for college campuses has been creating better resources for sexual assault
                reporting and education. The data shows that the number of reported rapes nationwide has been increasing
                by ~800 each each year (Figure 3). This increase in reporting is most likely due to better education and
                making victims feel more confident in coming forward, however there is no hard data to back that claim up.
                Schools can use this tool to easily monitor the crimes committed on their campuses and use the data to fine-tune
                the policy they put into action.

                It was also interesting to look at the difference between colleges in Boston and Cambridge. These cities are often see as interchangeable,
                but there there are many important differences. This is visible when looking at the alcohol related infractions between large schools
                (Greater Than 10,000 students). Boston schools are consistently a couple hundred above national average (~220), whereas
                Cambridge schools are consistently under (Figure 4). This could be for a variety of reasons, but ultimately comes down to
                the culture of the schools. This could be attributed to MIT and Harvard being more prestigious schools so maybe the students
                do not party as much. This however is false. Many Northeastern students actually go to MIT frat parties and Harvard also has a
                very active nightlife. What makes these parties different is that both MIT and Harvard can
                <a href="https://adamshouse.harvard.edu/party-registration" target="_blank">register</a> their parties.
                MIT frats let police know ahead of time when they are hosting an event and at Harvard students must register their
                parties with the school. This is different from Boston schools where RAs or Police shutting down a party is much more common.
                It would be interesting to see what would happen if Boston schools adopted these policies.
